Comprehensive Architecture for PPET: Defense-Oriented PUF Emulation and Analysis Framework
1. Introduction
The PPET (Physical Unclonable Function Emulation and Analysis Tool) framework is an open-source, Python-based software designed to simulate and evaluate Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for defense and national security applications. PUFs leverage manufacturing variations in hardware to create unique digital fingerprints, critical for secure key generation, device authentication, and tamper resistance in military systems. Unlike existing tools like pypuf, which focus on academic research, PPET addresses defense-specific needs by incorporating advanced threat modeling, operational stressors, and tailored use cases.
This document outlines the architecture of PPET, including its components, variables, dependencies, and considerations for scalability, performance, and security. It is designed to be comprehensive for a thesis, providing a clear structure for implementation, validation, and documentation.
2. High-Level Architecture
PPET is structured as a modular framework to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility. The architecture comprises five main modules:

Core Module: Handles PUF emulation, threat simulation, and performance analysis.
Use Case Module: Defines defense-specific scenarios (e.g., secure communication, drone authentication).
Utilities Module: Provides supporting tools like data generation and configuration management.
Interfaces Module: Facilitates user interaction via a command-line interface (CLI) or optional graphical user interface (GUI).
Documentation and Reporting Module: Generates user guides, API documentation, and threat/resilience reports.

2.1. Data Flow
The workflow of PPET follows these steps:

User Input: Users select a use case or define custom simulation parameters via the interface.
Configuration: The framework loads parameters (e.g., PUF type, attack type, environmental conditions).
Simulation: The PUF Emulator generates PUF instances, and the Threat Simulation Module applies attacks.
Analysis: The Analysis Module computes metrics (e.g., uniqueness, reliability) and generates visualizations.
Output: Results are displayed via the interface, and reports are generated for documentation.
